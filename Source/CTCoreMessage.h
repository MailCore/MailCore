/**
 CTCoreMessage is how you work with messages. The easiest way to instantiate a CTCoreMessage
 is to first setup a CTCoreAccount object and then get a CTCoreFolder object and then use it's
 convenience method messageWithUID: to get a message object you can work with.

 Anything that begins with "fetch", requires that an active network connection is present.
