##Getting the code

First checkout the code and pulldown the required dependencies as submodules:

    git clone https://github.com/mronge/MailCore.git
    cd MailCore/
    git submodule update --update

Now open up MailCore.xcodeproj and build either the iOS static library or the Mac OS X framework depending on your needs.

## Running Tests

TestData/account.plist will be required to run the CTConnectedTest/CTCoreFolder tests - see the top of Tests/CTConnectedTest.m for instructions on creating this file. You can turn these network-dependent tests off via Edit Scheme in XCode - deslect both of these classes in the Test action section, inside the Tests target. Tests will run substantially faster.

If the big Test button doesn't work for the project, you can again Edit Scheme, select the Test and choose the Tests target for the Test action.

Happy testing!

## Migrating to Version 1.0

The latest version of MailCore is no longer backwards compatible with earlier versions. I tried to keep backwards compatibility, but it became too complex, sorry :(

The biggest change is that exceptions are no longer used. Instead each method either returns a BOOL or an object that can be checked for success. If an error occurs each object has a `- (NSError *)lastError` method that can be consulted.

Here are a list of major changes:

* The method `- (int)fetchBody` has been renamed to `- (BOOL)fetchBodyStructure`
* The methods `messageObjectsFromIndex:toIndex:` and `messageListWithFetchAttributes:` have both been removed. They've been replaced by the new and improved `messagesFromSequenceNumber:to:withFetchAttributes:` and `messagesFromUID:to:withFetchAttributes:`. Please see the header file CTCoreFolder.m for details.
- NSException is no longer used, instead NSError is used.
- A CTCoreMessage's to, from, sender, bcc, cc, and subject values are nil when they have not been downloaded or message doesn't have them
- Message UIDs are now NSUIntegers instead of NSStrings
- `- (BOOL)isUIDValid:(NSString *)uid` has been removed. Instead check your uid validity value manually

Thanks,
