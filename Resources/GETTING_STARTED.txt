GETTING STARTED

The best way to start learning MailCore is by reading through
documentation intro (in index.html) and the the included example
projects. To run the example projects:

1. Copy MailCore.framework to your ~/Library/Frameworks folder.
2. In each example project, add ~/Library/Frameworks/MailCore.framework
   to the list of Linked Frameworks.
3. Build it!

The documentation isn't as detailed as I'd like. Sorry about that! If
something isn't clear try reading the source included or contact me.

IPHONE USE

MailCore has an included iPhone target, but it requires some
additional compiled binaries (OpenSSL and CyrusSSL). I am unable to
currently provide these, however the company Remail is offering the
binaries and a compiled copy of MailCore for the iPhone. Contact
Remail for more information:
